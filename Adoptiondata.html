         <h1>Adoption Data</h1>
         <p>These visualizations show the different data on adoptable dogs in various locations and looks at these dogs based on different 
            factors such as size, behaviors and traits. The data reveals how certain behaviors can cause dogs to stay in shelters
            and also how size plays a role in adoptions rates.

            This pie chart breaks down adoptable dogs by size, with Medium dogs dominating at 51.4%, followed by 
            Large dogs at 27.1%, Small dogs at 19.9%, and Extra Large dogs at just 1.6%. The preference for small-sized 
            dogs in adoptions likely reflects their easy lifestyle, they're small enough for living in the suburbs or 
            for apartment living, which is usually taken into consideration during adoption. Shelter data shows that small 
            dogs spend an average of 2.7 months in shelters, medium-sized dogs 4.5 months, and large dogs 10.4 months, 
            meaning large dogs need almost 4 times longer to get adopted compared to smaller dogs, which explains the data.

            This parallel categories diagram reveals how four interconnected factors (mixed breed status, special needs, 
            house training, and age) shape adoption patterns. The flowing bands between categories illuminate important 
            trends in the adoptable dog population. Mixed breed dogs constitute a substantial portion of adoptable animals, 
            reflecting typical shelter demographics. Unsurprisingly, most adopted dogs do not have special needs, as families 
            often prefer dogs requiring less specialized care or medical attention. However, house training status plays a 
            smaller role than expected. Non-house-trained dogs are adopted in numbers nearly comparable to house-trained 
            ones, suggesting that many adopters prioritize other factors like temperament and appearance, or are simply 
            willing to invest time in training.
            Age emerges as a more critical factor, with senior dogs noticeably underrepresented in adoptions. The diagram 
            also reveals a logical relationship between age and house training: most house-trained dogs are Young or Adult, 
            while Baby dogs are typically untrained (expected for puppies), and Senior dogs show mixed training status. 
            These patterns highlight both the flexibility adopters show regarding some factors and the persistent 
            preferences in other categories.

            This stacked bar chart compares house training rates between male and female adoptable dogs (with an "Unknown" 
            category), showing that both genders have similar proportions of house-trained versus not house-trained dogs. 
            Surprisingly, this graph shows that being house trained or not is not one of the main factors taken into 
            consideration by families when adopting dogs. However, it is also worth noting that female the count of female
            dogs in general was much higher than that of male dogs suggesting that people prefer to adopt male dogs.
