         <h1>NYC Dogs</h1>
         <p style="text-align: center;">Being one of the biggest cities in the world, New York City has a lot of dogs in it. This page shows the different varieties
            of dogs that live in NYC as well as some statistics about their breeds, names, and bite histories utilizing bar
            charts, pie charts, and histograms.
         </p>

            <embed src="./Top_ten.html"

         </div>
         <p style="text-align: center;">This visualization shows the top ten most common names for dogs living in New York City. This data shows that out of 
            thousands of names, Max and Bella are easily the most common having around 300 more counts than any other name. It shows that
            New Yorkers tend to prefer these two names above all others overall. It is also shown that half the names on this list end in a "y"
            suggesting that this format of name is most popular in New York City. The most popular name being Bella also suggests that
            female dogs are more popular in New York City than male dogs and some of our other data also lines up with this.
         </p>

         <p style="text-align: center;">
            This bar graph shows the top ten most common dog breeds in New York City and it is clear from this data that
            mutts are the most popular 'breed' by a large margin of about 23,000 more dogs of this category than the second most popular breed,
            the Yorkshire Terrier. This suggests that most New Yorkers prefer mixed breed dogs rather than pure breed dogs which could
            be due to mixed breed dogs generally being cheaper and the cost of living in NYC already being so high. It is also interesting
            to note that over half of the breeds listed are small dogs showing that New Yorkers have a preference for smaller dogs since they are easier to
            take care of in a city environment.

          <p style="text-align: center;">
            This histogram shows the distribution of dog bites in New York City by the borough that each bite occurred in.
            It is clear from the data that Queens has the highest number of dog bites by a large margin of around 500 more bites than the next borough, Manhattan.
            This suggests that Queens either has more aggressive dogs than the other boroughs or more dogs in general which would lead to more bites overall. 
            On the other hand, Staten Island has by far the least number of dog bites which could suggest it has either the friendliest dogs or 
            the least number of dogs in general.
          </p>
          <div style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: fit-content;">
            <embed src="./Gender_bites_NYC.html"
            type="text/html" height="700" width="1000" />
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            This pie chart reveals a significant gender disparity in dog bite incidents in NYC, with Male dogs (labeled "M") accounting for approximately 
            46.5% of bites, Female dogs 38.8%, and Unknown gender 15%. This gender difference in bite incidents may relate to territorial behavior, intact versus 
            neutered status, and other behavioral factors. Male dogs are known to exhibit more aggressive behaviors which could 
            contribute to their higher bite rates. The large "Unknown" category also suggests that collecting this data is more
            challenging than one might expect.
         </p>
          <div style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: fit-content;">
            <embed src="./Bite_breeds_NYC.html"
            type="text/html" height="700" width="1000" />
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            We can also notice this trend of high “Unknown” breed value in dog bites in NYC. According to <a href="https://www.pr.com/press-release/955689">https://www.pr.com/press-release/955689</a>, from 2015 to 2023, 
            bites attributed to dogs of "unknown" breed increased 119%, with a dramatic 97% surge occurring post-COVID from 2020 to 2023. This trend followed 
            two key policy changes: a 2015 city law requiring rescues and pet shops to obtain dog licenses at the point of adoption or purchase, and the November 2017 "boroughbred" 
            campaign that removed breed labels at New York City's largest shelter system. This data reflects a similar challenge to data collecting as once 
            again the unknown category is a large portion of the data shown.
